# InduDoc Transformer
This repository is a core part of the project for PDF industrial extractor software. The project will follow a lean development approach, integrate Software Engineering processes, and be developed publicly on GitHub under an MIT License.
The project aim is to develop an open-source software solution for the conversion of industry-specific PDF documents, such as EPlan documentation, into structured XML format. This process will involve an intermediate step - a database (potentially a VectorDB for future LLM integration) to assist data extraction and transformation. Key features will include the ability to handle user-configurable "levels" or separators within documents, track content across pages, and associate these structural elements with embedded images.
